# Activ8

Your Personal Health Activisor

## Motivation

Many students at UCI are living on their own for the first time. Many feel intimidated and struggle to keep up with taking care of themselves. In contrast, others simply neglect regular physical activity, a well-balanced diet they enjoy, and a consistent quality sleep schedule. Focusing on these things helps students effectively study for their exams and eventually build a career and family. A better quality of life has been shown to improve mental and physical well-being.

## Feature Overview

Activ8 is a recommendation system that:

- Asks you to log your meals
- Tracks your step data
- Monitors your sleep habits

Using this information, Activ8:

- Provides recommendations on things to eat that you'd likely enjoy
- Gives you daily weather-sensitive advice on how to reach your step goal
- Suggests a healthy sleeping schedule around your circadian rhythm and busy schedule
